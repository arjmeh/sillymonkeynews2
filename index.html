        A small conservative faction found in the suburbs of eastern
        <br />Ukraine had dubbed themselves, “Ukrussia.” Although<br />
        this newly formed faction has been disregarded by both<br />
        Nato and the USA respectively, Ukrussia has now allied with Russia,<br />
        forming a newly formed faction, dubbed, “Ukrussiarussia.”<br />
        This divergent faction has faced fire on Social Media, from<br />
        platforms like Twitter, Snapchat, and most famously, TikTok.<br />
        More trouble would come for Ukrussiarussia. Economic<br />
        downturn from both Ukraine and Russia has impacted<br />
        Ukrussiarussia more than the respective countries.<br />
        And even a more devastating loss, when Donald McDonald,<br />
        a supporting American billionaire, has gone<br />
        overweight and declined from society, thus making funds<br />
        for Ukrussiarussia, practically impossible to get. More reports<br />
        coming soon, from SMNews.

        Apple is Closing Down After Lawsuit<br />
        With Microsoft

        Apple is closing down after a lawsuit with Microsoft.<br />
        Apple was given a copyright claim for copying one of Microsoft's<br />
        products: Microsoft Word. Apple developed Apple Word,<br />
        an almost identical replica of Microsoft Word. After a few<br />
        months, Microsoft employee Jen Stevenson found out that<br />
        Apple was copying Microsoft. She quickly filed a copyright<br />
        claim with the Washington Police and immediately caught<br />
        Apple's attention. Tim Cook tried to fight with the lawyer<br />
        but immediately realized that he wouldn't win. He was<br />
        devasted when the lawyer sent him to jail and forced Apple<br />
        to shut down on March 1, 2022. Many people try to justify<br />
        what Apple did but the lawyer did not get Tim a bail. Tim<br />
        Cook said that he would try to start a new company<br />
        called Orange, but he is in jail for the next seven years<br />
        so he can't. If you have an Apple product, the warranty<br />
        will expire, and the product will stop working in 21 days.

        Russian military forced their way into Kyiv, attacking by land and air.<br> Ukrainian soldiers came in to defend their capital. Volodymyr Zelenskyy<br> vowed he would not surrender until every Russian soldier was gone. Vladimir<br> Putin even called him a terrorist. On Friday, Mr. Zelenskyy posted a video<br> from Kyiv stating that "We are all here, defending our independence."<br> Ukrainian troops blew up bridges leading to Kyiv to slow the progress of<br> Russian tanks that were moving towards the city.<br>

      <h4 class="text"> Ukrainian tanks and artillery were positioned to deflect a ground assault<br> that Russia was hinting at. Ukraine was able to withstand the first Russian<br> assault but was heavily impacted by the bombings. Ukrainian officials even sought<br> help from the U.S., and other Western countries, warning them of the<br> consequences that would ensue. In the White House, Jen Psaki warned<br> "Kyiv falling is a real possibility. Even as we see resistance on the ground, Russia's<br> military continues to advance toward Kyiv." Mr. Putin's attacks raised the risk that<br> violence could spread into other surrounding countries. If Moscow wins,<br> Russia could have the potential to place forces on the border of NATO. Oleksii<br> Reznikov stated that "Ukrainians are now fighting for the future they deserve.<br> For themselves and all of Europe." The Biden administration said that they<br> were thinking of offering support to the Ukrainian military, but defense<br> officials have not yet stated when this assistance would be delivered.</h4>
