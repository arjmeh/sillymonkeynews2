        A small conservative faction found in the suburbs of eastern
        <br />Ukraine had dubbed themselves, “Ukrussia.” Although<br />
        this newly formed faction has been disregarded by both<br />
        Nato and the USA respectively,, Ukrussia has now allied with Russia,<br />
        forming a newly formed faction, dubbed, “Ukrussiarussia.”<br />
        This divergent faction has faced fire on Social Media, from<br />
        platforms like Twitter, Snapchat, and most famously, TikTok.<br />
        More trouble would come for Ukrussiarussia. Economic<br />
        downturn from both Ukraine and Russia has impacted<br />
        Ukrussiarussia more than the respective countries.<br />
        And even a more devastating loss, when Donald McDonald,<br />
        a supporting American billionaire, has gone<br />
        overweight and declined from society, thus making funds<br />
        for Ukrussiarussia, practically impossible to get. More reports<br />
        coming soon, from SMNews.

        Apple is Closing Down After Lawsuit<br />
        With Microsoft
      </h2>

        Apple is closing down after a lawsuit with Microsoft.<br />
        Apple was given a copyright claim for copying one of Microsoft's<br />
        products: Microsoft Word. Apple developed Apple Word,<br />
        an almost identical replica of Microsoft Word. After a few<br />
        months, Microsoft employee Jen Stevenson found out that<br />
        Apple was copying Microsoft. She quickly filed a copyright<br />
        claim with the Washington Police and immediately caught<br />
        Apple's attention. Tim Cook tried to fight with the lawyer<br />
        but immediately realized that he wouldn't win. He was<br />
        devasted when the lawyer sent him to jail and forced Apple<br />
        to shut down on March 1, 2022. Many people try to justify<br />
        what Apple did but the lawyer did not get Tim a bail. Tim<br />
        Cook said that he would try to start a new company<br />
        called Orange, but he is in jail for the next seven years<br />
        so he can't. If you have an Apple product, the warranty<br />
        will expire, and the product will stop working in 21 days.

      <h4 class="text">You can't fart in public in Florida. After a child farted<br>
        in front of David Samson, the whole of Florida was in shock.<br>
        The fart smelled so bad that David couldn't breathe<br> and
        had to get away from the child. After some searching,<br>
        government officials found the child who did this crime.<br>
        Ever since then, farting has been banned in public in Florida.<br>
        If you fart in public, you could be sentenced to community<br>
        service for a month or even be arrested if the fart induces<br>
        agony. Thousands of people don't know about this rule<br>
        in Florida and are in danger. If things go wrong and they fart,<br>
        it could be over. Almost 7000 people have gotten arrested for<br> the non-violent crime. The president of Russia even stated<br> that he would go to Florida and fart everywhere. Citizens were in shock<br> when he said that so they went to Russia and farted in his face. This made<br> him so angry that he banned farting in Russia.</h4>
