          "I like pock," said the creator of Pock Middle School, a new school for stupid students from Rock Middle School. Students quickly transferred<br> because they heard that Pock Middle School had clean toilets, which was a dream for all students in Rock Middle School. But when<br> they transferred they realized it was all fake and Pock Middle School had toilets which had been rubbed with poop. The students were still happy because<br> they got food, which was banned at Rock Middle School. The owner of Rock Middle School, Donald Rock said, "i am truly disgusted<br> with you poopy students for leaving this poopy school." (why do i keep writing about poop lol)

The official hearing for the school is said to be scheduled on the 28th of March in New York City.

          The students of dine dalley middle school were in shock today after a balloon reportedly "activated the fire alarm." The fire alarm<br> rang at around 7:45 AM, 20 minutes before school starts in Dine Dalley. A reporter on the case was just "wandering around when all of a sudden<br> I heard a ringing and screams across the campus." Millions of students were heading to the corner of the blacktop, the only place where they were safe.<br> Then, when all hope was almost lost, the firetrucks arrived. You could hear sighs of relief from the students who thought they wouldn't make it. One kid<br> even started to cry and said "I don't want to lose my v-bucks!!!" because his Mom said to him earlier that when he died, she would take all his v-bucks.<br> Thankfully, everyone got out safe and the balloon was sent to jail.

        <img src="https://www.truthordareofficial.com/article/en/game-rules/feature-image-1200x630.jpg" alt="Truth or Dare">
        <h4 class="text">
          For a real truth or dare, one must present the item (the dare) that the victim must be able to recognize. In this case,<br> we will be using rat feces. Another rule of thumb is to always present the dare IRL, so one must gain the expected reaction and the optimal amount of fun from this<br> experience. The implication of a dare is also something used in great dares.

        A good dare: "Spreading rat feces on my grandma's spatula is so annoying, can you<br> spread it for me?"

        The above is a great dare, as it implies that the giver of the dare (GOD) is already doing this, in fact, it also applies fun to the victim as well. The GOD<br> has successfully been able to imply, be there in person, and has presented something recognizable (though I don't recommend this dare, it's quite boring and also<br> too slow (Waiting for the person to go to the grandma's house)).

        For a truth, simply asking anything embarrassing, (crushes, secrets, search history) should be good enough.<br> Be keen, however, as a common excuse is that they don't have a crush, secret, or other truths so they, therefore, can not share it. That's simply impossible. They are<br> someone with hormones and also they accepted a truth/dare.

        Earlier today a new country was discovered called<br> The Shrekonian Republic. This country’s population<br> is not yet known but it is known that the country is<br> full of variations of Shrek. Not much is known about<br> this country because it is fairly new and unheard of<br> but the country is proving itself useful by being one<br> of the top candle producers in the world. As you know<br> Shrek can make candles from the stuff in his ears<br> and that there are a bunch of slaves picking the stuff<br> out of their ears 24/7 to produce candles. Because<br> of this The Shrekonian Republic is now richer than<br> most countries and only a few countries top it in<br> wealth. The geography is mostly swamplands so it is<br> hard to get around. If you are planning to go on<br> vacation to The Shrekonian Republic it is recommended<br> to bring boots no matter what. President Boe Jiden<br> will be going there next friday to discuss trade and other stuff.

          The other day a correspondent for SMNews was scrolling through Instagram when he read that Silly Rabbit News was accusing Silly Monkey News<br> of putting fake news on their website. She was outraged and informed CEO Arjun Mehrotra immediately, what happened next will shock you. A few hours later,<br> another guy on Instagram posted a video of a guy who works for Silly Rabbit news making up a fake news story. In the video he said “I'm too lazy to report a story so I'm<br> gonna make one up”. Earlier today Silly Rabbit News published a story about aliens riding donkeys invading Montana. This was clearly fake and now the CEO of Silly<br> Rabbit news is under fire and being accused of posting fake news on their website. Even president Boe Jiden said “this type of behavior is unacceptable” and a<br> #CancelSillyRabbitNews is now spreading throughout social media.

          Students from Rock Middle School have been posting this viral image across many social media platforms. The student was identified as a Rock Middle School<br> student. Apparently, that student was in such a hurry during the passing period, he didn’t have enough to go the the actual toilet, and instead just sat on the urinal,<br> so he thought when he was done doing his business he would just sprint off a few seconds before the bell, in time to make it for his next class and not get a tardy. Because<br> of sanitization purposes, the student was unfortunately called to the office on the speakers during student support, a few minutes before the bell. His parents were in the office,<br> and they yelled at him about why it’s dumb to poop in urinals. Students in the bathroom also complained that the poop had a stench that made two students pass out. Even<br> after cleaning, the bathroom smelled like his poop, and no scented air sprays would do the trick. Now Rock Middle School will have to reconstruct the whole bathroom again, and<br> the students will have to use all of the other bathrooms which are very claustrophobic. The principal gave him a week-long suspension. Nothing else was reported of the student<br> after he went home, but neighbors say they could hear a lot of screaming and yelling and have reported the house and its residents for being “too noisy”, unaware of the child<br> being suspended and his consequences.

          After years of being president, Boe Jiden has retired and has taken place as the new "Ronald McDonald". Boe stated that he "got bored and<br> wanted to do something that brought meaning to my life." Investigators have investigated further into this topic and found out that Doe had always wanted to be Ronald McDonald<br> but Ronald McDonald never quit until last week. McDonalds interviewed Doe and tested him on his farting and burping skills. He passed the interview with a 102%<br> because the interviewer fainted after he smelt the fart. When Doe Jiden left, Tonald Drump took his place and became the new president.

        During the middle of a football game in Denver,<br> Colorado, a cat ran onto the field. The players tried to<br> pet it, but it would always run away. One time, a player<br> was almost close enough to pet it, but the cat jumped<br> on his face and stole the helmet. The other players and fans<br> thought it was hysterical. The player without his<br> helmet (Rob) did not. He picked up the football and<br> threw it at the cat, but the cat just head-butted it because<br> it was wearing the helmet. Rob got so angry that he<br> fainted. The players laughed at Rob so hard that some<br> of them fell to the ground. The ones who did,<br> were attacked by the cat, their helmets were stolen,<br> and the cat ran away before security could call the<br> SPCA or Animal Control. The cat lived happily ever after.<br> The players did not.

        Vets Have designed dentures for dogs who have lost<br> all their teeth so they can eat hard candies that their<br> owner's children leave on the floor. However, children<br> have decided to start putting the dog dentures in their<br> 11-13 year old siblings lunches. The kids think that the<br> dentures are made of gelatin and decide to bite the<br> dentures causing them to lose their teeth. Parents<br> are threatening to sue the Dog Dentures™ company.

        The Dreamworks productions movie released in 2008<br> Over the Hedge has been deemed a cinematic<br> masterpiece by the academy due to its amazing action<br> and plot. This caused disarray among shrek fans who<br> have resorted to writing strongly worded emails saying<br> the raccoon isn't "Shrexy" enough and that he should<br> be pried of his award. In response to this nomination,<br> Dreamworks decided to scrap Shrek 5's development<br> in favor of Over The Hedge 2 and have started fans<br> storming the studio in mobs carrying a large inflatable<br> shrek.

        In the newly formed world war, the emu's held at<br> the Australian museum have been freed by the sea<br> otters and immediately beelined for the west coast.<br> Boe Jiden thought that they would be trapped on the<br> island as they are flightless birds but he was<br> proven wrong as they were apparently going so fast<br> that they were walking on water. After making it<br> to California they have swiftly taken the city. The<br> only stronghold left lies at rock middle school as<br> the animal kingdom celebrates.
