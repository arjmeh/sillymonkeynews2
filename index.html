        The Shrek gender is taking over the world! In a matter<br> of a day the Shrek gender has grown from 50 to 50,000<br> and this wasn't from Shrek and his ancestors producing<br> them this is from a new virus. This virus is called the<br> Shrekonavirus. It is taking the world by storm. People<br> are already sick of Covid-19 and now they have to go<br> through the Shrekonavirus. To prevent getting the<br> Shrekonavirus you have to wear a medical bodysuit and<br> three N95 masks. This can be spread through a<br> Shrek touching you. The numbers are also increasing<br> because of people wanting to become Shrek. This is<br> becoming a Shrek apocalypse and people need to spread<br> the word to be safe.

        After 3 years of constant riots against China a single<br> middle aged woman finally collapsed the great wall of<br> China. She say her motives were blaming them for<br> "These hideous things" what she was referring to is still<br> unknown as after the wall collapsed due to an unstable<br> structure they were detained. People all around the world<br> are saying that it was justified as it would have collapsed<br> anyway because of the idiotdic tourists taking it apart<br> brick by brick. The Chinese government have avoided<br> elaborating as they concoct a cover up saying that it was<br> destroyed by a troop of American soldiers in an attempt<br> to kill thousands. The state of the woman responsible<br> is currently unknown as the president focuses on more<br> pressing matters like banning any and all Winnie the Pooh<br> merchandise.

        Due to a sudden surge of people buying the new iphones,<br> and ipads, people have been only playing mobile games<br> on their new apple products. This sudden surge in mobile<br> games has greatly increased the networth of games like<br> brawl stars, clash royale, but not Minecraft. The current<br> owner of apple (Tim Cook), had a feud with Minecraft’s<br> current owner (Markus Persson), because they both went<br> on a date, but it ended with them breaking up for an unknown<br> reason, so apple decided not to let Minecraft be available<br> on their mobile apple products. This greatly impacted<br> Markus Persson so much that in the next few days,<br> Minecraft is bound to go bankrupt. With only 50 cents<br> left in their 1 stock, they have no chance of coming back<br> on the leaderboard. Everyone, wish your final goodbye to Minecraft…

        Shrek 5 is coming out in theaters. After popular demand,<br> the public requested that there should be a Shrek 5. Fans<br> realised that Shrek Forever After wasn't enough. This<br> brought Dreamworks attention so they gathered Eddie<br> Murphy (Donkey), Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz<br> (Fiona), and the rest of the Shrek cast to start filming<br> and animating the movie. Shrek fans do everything to<br> honor Shrek, they vary from Shrek meetups, you see<br> profile pictures of Shrek, even they came up with a<br> new phrase called Shrexy. So, as you can see Shrek<br> has grown over the years and after Dreamworks<br> announced that Shrek 5 is coming out the fan base<br> grew even more. The fans are elated for the movie<br> to be released in September 2022.

        Joe Rogan was driving his 2002 Honda Civic near<br> a pack of Psychopathic ducks when a duck ran<br> in front of his car. Of course Joe would not hurt a<br> fly so he quickly served to the right to avoid the<br> near helpless quaker but that is not even the worst<br> part. Since he was driving next to an ice fishing pond<br> and his car was on the ice he hit 9 of the 82 ice fishers<br> there until his car hit another duck so it stopped. Though<br> that is still not the worst part (Well I guess it is) because<br> one of the people that he hit was none other than the<br> girl from the carseat meme (She and another duck were<br> found in a frozen block of ice, and of course they were<br> dead). Joe Rogan was sued 24 Million dollars in all from<br> about 840 professional memers. Shaquille O’Neal<br> commented on this incident saying quote, “If little Joey<br> hits another person he will have to face the consequences.<br> Thank you for reading this article and I hope you never<br> end up like Joey because Shaq will come for you.

The estimated arrival date of the<br> second sun is august, 2023.  Scientist believe that it will not<br> affect the earth in any way.  This is because the second sun<br> is behind the first sun.  Scientist have developed a name for<br> name for this sun, and it is Sun 2, which is definitely different<br> then the first suns name, Sun 1.  Hopefully, Sun 2 is not larger<br> than Sun 1, because if it is, than Earth could instantly disintegrate.<br>  Readers, be careful for this sun.

Simply speaking, the student was<br> going so fast that we couldn’t see him, and he was so bored<br> having everybody slow down that he came back to the real<br> world. Joe Biden's long-lost nephew, Bo Triden, is the 8th<br> grader we are talking about. Bo Triden has claimed numerous<br> times that “after I broke the 20 second mile time, I was ready<br>to break the sound barrier.” He had also claimed to go to<br> Narnia. Although there are numerous suspicions about Bo<br> Triden lying, everything has been proved.

      <h4 class="text"> Ukrainian tanks and artillery were positioned to deflect a ground assault<br> that Russia was hinting at. Ukraine was able to withstand the first Russian<br> assault but was heavily impacted by the bombings.

In the White House, Jen Psaki warned<br> "Kyiv falling is a real possibility. Even as we see resistance on the ground, Russia's<br> military continues to advance toward Kyiv." Mr. Putin's attacks raised the risk that<br> violence could spread into other surrounding countries. If Moscow wins,<br> Russia could have the potential to place forces on the border of NATO. Oleksii<br> Reznikov stated that "Ukrainians are now fighting for the future they deserve.<br> For themselves and all of Europe." The Biden administration said that they<br> were thinking of offering support to the Ukrainian military, but defense<br> officials have not yet stated when this assistance would be delivered.</h4>

      There is a new gender that has been discovered. It is<br> called the Shrek gender, scientists found that the<br> population of the gender is 50 but it is slowly increasing<br> by the day. This gender can only be produced by the<br> one and only Shrek and his ancestors. The offspring<br> is formed into an identical baby Shrek. There are<br> several lab studies about this odd gender and scientists<br> are starting to adapt what they are doing. The average<br> day of a Shrek is to stay in their swamp, not be bothered,<br> and sleep. Scientists are starting to love the lifestyle of<br> this Shrek gender that to this day over 1500 scientists<br> have quit their job and started to do what they are doing.
