        Shrek 5 is coming out in theaters. After popular demand,<br> the public requested that there should be a Shrek 5. Fans<br> realised that Shrek Forever After wasn't enough. This<br> brought Dreamworks attention so they gathered Eddie<br> Murphy (Donkey), Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz<br> (Fiona), and the rest of the Shrek cast to start filming<br> and animating the movie. Shrek fans do everything to<br> honor Shrek, they vary from Shrek meetups, you see<br> profile pictures of Shrek, even they came up with a<br> new phrase called Shrexy. So, as you can see Shrek<br> has grown over the years and after Dreamworks<br> announced that Shrek 5 is coming out the fan base<br> grew even more. The fans are elated for the movie<br> to be released in September 2022.

        Joe Rogan was driving his 2002 Honda Civic near<br> a pack of Psychopathic ducks when a duck ran<br> in front of his car. Of course Joe would not hurt a<br> fly so he quickly served to the right to avoid the<br> near helpless quaker but that is not even the worst<br> part. Since he was driving next to an ice fishing pond<br> and his car was on the ice he hit 9 of the 82 ice fishers<br> there until his car hit another duck so it stopped. Though<br> that is still not the worst part (Well I guess it is) because<br> one of the people that he hit was none other than the<br> girl from the carseat meme (She and another duck were<br> found in a frozen block of ice, and of course they were<br> dead). Joe Rogan was sued 24 Million dollars in all from<br> about 840 professional memers. Shaquille O’Neal<br> commented on this incident saying quote, “If little Joey<br> hits another person he will have to face the consequences.<br> Thank you for reading this article and I hope you never<br> end up like Joey because Shaq will come for you.

        Recently, the sun has been getting larger in some parts.<br>  This is believed to be because the sun, is splitting into two<br> wholes.  Scientists believe this is because of binary fission,<br> a form of asexual reproduction.  People are now questioning<br> if the sun is actually alive.  The estimated arrival date of the<br> second sun is august, 2023.  Scientist believe that it will not<br> affect the earth in any way.  This is because the second sun<br> is behind the first sun.  Scientist have developed a name for<br> name for this sun, and it is Sun 2, which is definitely different<br> then the first suns name, Sun 1.  Hopefully, Sun 2 is not larger<br> than Sun 1, because if it is, than Earth could instantly disintegrate.<br>  Readers, be careful for this sun. If it tries to disintegrate you,<br> don’t worry, call 911 and they should help you(if they haven’t<br>  been disintegrated already)

Many people are surprised as to why he would leave<br> such a prestigous position at one of the most popular fast<br> food chains in history. Scientists believe it was because<br> "little kids would bully him for looking like an idiot" says<br> scientist from McDonalds University. A lot of people have<br> gone into depression after their famous mascot left. Johnson<br> Pooip said "I love Ronald and wish I could marry him."

Doe Jiden has been replaced with Tonald<br> Drump, a former president and government worker. Scientists<br> have said that the rgb light in gaming mouses is so powerful<br> that if you compare it to the sun, it would win. This is a huge<br> problem for major companies because now they have to<br> remove the rgb factor of their mouses, which was the only<br> reason people would buy it.

Mr. Putin's attacks raised the risk that<br> violence could spread into other surrounding countries. If Moscow wins,<br> Russia could have the potential to place forces on the border of NATO. Oleksii<br> Reznikov stated that "Ukrainians are now fighting for the future they deserve.<br> For themselves and all of Europe."

        Apple is closing down after a lawsuit with Microsoft.<br />
        Apple was given a copyright claim for copying one of Microsoft's<br />
        products: Microsoft Word. Apple developed Apple Word,<br />
        an almost identical replica of Microsoft Word. After a few<br />
        months, Microsoft employee Jen Stevenson found out that<br />
        Apple was copying Microsoft. She quickly filed a copyright<br />
        claim with the Washington Police and immediately caught<br />
        Apple's attention. Tim Cook tried to fight with the lawyer<br />
        but immediately realized that he wouldn't win. He was<br />
        devasted when the lawyer sent him to jail and forced Apple<br />
        to shut down on March 1, 2022. Many people try to justify<br />
        what Apple did but the lawyer did not get Tim a bail. Tim<br />
        Cook said that he would try to start a new company<br />
        called Orange, but he is in jail for the next seven years<br />
        so he can't. If you have an Apple product, the warranty<br />
        will expire, and the product will stop working in 21 days.
