          Young 6th Grader Sebas Benitez has been elected our new president. His partner in crime Baylen Levine will be joining him as the Vice President.<br> There have already been changes into our laws. President Benitez demanded that a person who doesn't listen to Lil Yachty in their car and gets caught there will be fined<br> 6 million dollars. He has also stated that all Shrek movies will be free everywhere in the United States. Because of that impending occurrence the Dreamworks company<br> has shut down because they haven't made any money. We have not found out any more changes but it is still yet to come.

        <h4 class="text">
          For a real truth or dare, one must present the item (the dare) that the victim must be able to recognize. In this case,<br> we will be using rat feces. Another rule of thumb is to always present the dare IRL, so one must gain the expected reaction and the optimal amount of fun from this<br> experience. The implication of a dare is also something used in great dares.

        A good dare: "Spreading rat feces on my grandma's spatula is so annoying, can you<br> spread it for me?"

        The above is a great dare, as it implies that the giver of the dare (GOD) is already doing this, in fact, it also applies fun to the victim as well. The GOD<br> has successfully been able to imply, be there in person, and has presented something recognizable (though I don't recommend this dare, it's quite boring and also<br> too slow (Waiting for the person to go to the grandma's house)).

        For a truth, simply asking anything embarrassing, (crushes, secrets, search history) should be good enough.<br> Be keen, however, as a common excuse is that they don't have a crush, secret, or other truths so they, therefore, can not share it. That's simply impossible. They are<br> someone with hormones and also they accepted a truth/dare.

        Earlier today a new country was discovered called<br> The Shrekonian Republic. This country’s population<br> is not yet known but it is known that the country is<br> full of variations of Shrek. Not much is known about<br> this country because it is fairly new and unheard of<br> but the country is proving itself useful by being one<br> of the top candle producers in the world. As you know<br> Shrek can make candles from the stuff in his ears<br> and that there are a bunch of slaves picking the stuff<br> out of their ears 24/7 to produce candles. Because<br> of this The Shrekonian Republic is now richer than<br> most countries and only a few countries top it in<br> wealth. The geography is mostly swamplands so it is<br> hard to get around. If you are planning to go on<br> vacation to The Shrekonian Republic it is recommended<br> to bring boots no matter what. President Boe Jiden<br> will be going there next friday to discuss trade and other stuff.

          The other day a correspondent for SMNews was scrolling through Instagram when he read that Silly Rabbit News was accusing Silly Monkey News<br> of putting fake news on their website. She was outraged and informed CEO Arjun Mehrotra immediately, what happened next will shock you. A few hours later,<br> another guy on Instagram posted a video of a guy who works for Silly Rabbit news making up a fake news story. In the video he said “I'm too lazy to report a story so I'm<br> gonna make one up”. Earlier today Silly Rabbit News published a story about aliens riding donkeys invading Montana. This was clearly fake and now the CEO of Silly<br> Rabbit news is under fire and being accused of posting fake news on their website. Even president Boe Jiden said “this type of behavior is unacceptable” and a<br> #CancelSillyRabbitNews is now spreading throughout social media.

          Students from Rock Middle School have been posting this viral image across many social media platforms. The student was identified as a Rock Middle School<br> student. Apparently, that student was in such a hurry during the passing period, he didn’t have enough to go the the actual toilet, and instead just sat on the urinal,<br> so he thought when he was done doing his business he would just sprint off a few seconds before the bell, in time to make it for his next class and not get a tardy. Because<br> of sanitization purposes, the student was unfortunately called to the office on the speakers during student support, a few minutes before the bell. His parents were in the office,<br> and they yelled at him about why it’s dumb to poop in urinals. Students in the bathroom also complained that the poop had a stench that made two students pass out. Even<br> after cleaning, the bathroom smelled like his poop, and no scented air sprays would do the trick. Now Rock Middle School will have to reconstruct the whole bathroom again, and<br> the students will have to use all of the other bathrooms which are very claustrophobic. The principal gave him a week-long suspension. Nothing else was reported of the student<br> after he went home, but neighbors say they could hear a lot of screaming and yelling and have reported the house and its residents for being “too noisy”, unaware of the child<br> being suspended and his consequences.

          After years of being president, Boe Jiden has retired and has taken place as the new "Ronald McDonald". Boe stated that he "got bored and<br> wanted to do something that brought meaning to my life." Investigators have investigated further into this topic and found out that Doe had always wanted to be Ronald McDonald<br> but Ronald McDonald never quit until last week. McDonalds interviewed Doe and tested him on his farting and burping skills. He passed the interview with a 102%<br> because the interviewer fainted after he smelt the fart. When Doe Jiden left, Tonald Drump took his place and became the new president.

        During the middle of a football game in Denver,<br> Colorado, a cat ran onto the field. The players tried to<br> pet it, but it would always run away. One time, a player<br> was almost close enough to pet it, but the cat jumped<br> on his face and stole the helmet. The other players and fans<br> thought it was hysterical. The player without his<br> helmet (Rob) did not. He picked up the football and<br> threw it at the cat, but the cat just head-butted it because<br> it was wearing the helmet. Rob got so angry that he<br> fainted. The players laughed at Rob so hard that some<br> of them fell to the ground. The ones who did,<br> were attacked by the cat, their helmets were stolen,<br> and the cat ran away before security could call the<br> SPCA or Animal Control. The cat lived happily ever after.<br> The players did not.

In response to this nomination,<br> Dreamworks decided to scrap Shrek 5's development<br> in favor of Over The Hedge 2 and have started fans<br> storming the studio in mobs carrying a large inflatable<br> shrek.

          It is said that on February 20, 2022 a live Shrek was<br> caught on camera. Although the Shrek gender was<br> known of and that Shrek was real, very few have seen<br> him, let alone caught him on camera. That changed on an<br> evening of February where a hiker caught Shrek on<br> camera on Mt. Diablo. Several pictures were taken and it is<br> shown in the pictures that he has several weapons<br> holstered and sheathed around his waist. He did not<br> attack the hiker, but warned the hiker to “GET OUT<br> OF MY SWAMP” or he would be “shreked”. Bod Jiden<br> has ordered the S.W.A.T., F.B.I., C.I.A., and the S.M.N.P.D.<br> to find, contain, and escort Shrek to him. Not many<br> details are known, but Boe Jiden says that “The public<br> will be informed on the status of this situation very<br> soon.” More reports will be filed when said data<br> is released exclusively to SMNews.

        An unnamed, potentially deadly virus has found its way into one of the most dangerous places on earth. Did this deadly virus make its way into military bases?<br> No, this deadly virus has made its way into Rock Middle School. Rock Middle School is located at 37.2431° N, 115.7930° W, and although it’s found in the middle of nowhere<br> in Nevada, that doesn’t mean this Middle school is alive. Many students found at this Middle School have either been amputated with Ticonderoga pencils by “The Doctor’s<br> who wear those blue masks”, or smothered with poop. Now, not being able to take dumps in toilets isn’t the only problem found at Rock Middle School, the more<br> recent and deadly problem comes from Vorona Cirus. Vorona Cirus (VC) is a highly mutated version of COVID-19’s baby with Influenza.<br> This dangerous concoction of deadly and contagious diseases has already made some students flee to Loompa Land.<br> VC has been able to terrorize Rock Middle School, and although extremely inhumane, Joe Biden has decided to ultimately keep the students to die,<br> so VC will be eradicated. With a reluctant sigh, bid a sorrowful goodbye to the students at Rock Middle School… but what about the ones in Loompa Land? Find out soon.

      Kids are going to take over the world, Continued, I<br> just heard that now kids  won the election and are now<br> making games like minecraft and fortnite have to be<br> played at least 2 hours each day, the craziest thing has<br> yet to come, they are now banning school from 49/50<br> states, the last state is rhode island which is now causing<br> tons of people to move to rhode island making the<br> government having to buy more land. I just heard on live<br> news that the government bought all of France and now<br> said that they will take over all the seven wonders of the<br> world, Now people are moving there for an education.<br> The final thing I have to say is, the U.S now interrupted<br> the war between Russia and Ukraine and now are trying<br> to convince Russia to stop fighting and they will give Russia<br> land FOR FREE. This might be the best offer yet and maybe,<br> they will stop fighting. Finally, the only other school that is<br> not banned is rock middle, we think that that is the school<br> where these kids learn.

          During 1st period PE at Rock Middle school, students<br> experienced extreme fatigue. This was due to the PE<br> teachers forcing their students to run 50 miles<br> without stopping, or else they would fail the class.<br> PE instructors, Mr. Mood and Mr. Macintosh stated<br> “Our students are not exceeding the levels of athleticism<br> for state standard”. As of Friday students have started<br> boycotting the PE teachers by not changing to their PE<br> clothes as a protest to the Mile tests. In response to<br> the protests, Mr. Mood implied all students to run<br> 200 miles without stopping or else they wouldn’t<br> be accepted into a college. Outraged over the new<br> policy, Both students and teachers started setting<br> fire to PE equipment and the track. Dedicated<br> students went to the streets to protest the California<br> government for accepting child abuse.

        Rock Middle School has become the most chaotic<br> middle school in the world. After students pooped so<br> much that the toilets exploded, jumped off the tables<br> and broke their necks, made all pencils illegal, went to<br> Narnia, protested, and ran 200 miles, Rock Middle<br> School was in chaos. The teachers couldn't handle all<br> of this and started a hashtag called "#rockmiddleschoolsucks"<br> This hashtag has been trending on Twitter and Instagram<br> with almost 83 billion people using the hashtag worldwide.<br> Rock Middle School principal, Allan Rock, has been getting<br> many lawsuits recently because he was "cruel to the kids."<br> Rock Middle School has even been banned on all social media<br> after they posted a picture of their toiled full of poop.

The student was singing ‘Fight Song’<br> by Rachel Platten, according to other students she was<br> singing this because fellow classmates were bullying her<br> and she wanted to have “her moment”. Parents are<br> threatening to sue the school for not having safe tables.<br> The principal refuses to even pay for neck surgery because<br> the school is broke from the bathroom and cafeteria food<br> incident. The student was in the hospital but got kicked out<br> because her parents could not afford it. She now has to be<br> cared for in her parents house but her condition is only<br> getting worse.

        As you may have heard. A student from the 2022 8th<br> grade roster has gone missing for over 278,019 days.<br> The student would then materialize from ‘thin air,’ and<br> would wage war on all of humanity. What you may have<br> heard or witnessed, was a clever usage of Albert Einstein’s<br> theory of relativity. Simply speaking, the student was<br> going so fast that we couldn’t see him, and he was so bored<br> having everybody slow down that he came back to the real<br> world. Joe Biden's long-lost nephew, Bo Triden, is the 8th<br> grader we are talking about. Bo Triden has claimed numerous<br> times that “after I broke the 20 second mile time, I was ready<br>to break the sound barrier.” He had also claimed to go to<br> Narnia. Although there are numerous suspicions about Bo<br> Triden lying, everything has been proved. Just kidding, he was<br> on drugs and was accused of, “being a threat to the society<br> of Western Culture.”

In a matter<br> of a day the Shrek gender has grown from 50 to 50,000<br> and this wasn't from Shrek and his ancestors producing<br> them this is from a new virus. This virus is called the<br> Shrekonavirus. It is taking the world by storm. People<br> are already sick of Covid-19 and now they have to go<br> through the Shrekonavirus. To prevent getting the<br> Shrekonavirus you have to wear a medical bodysuit and<br> three N95 masks. This can be spread through a<br> Shrek touching you. The numbers are also increasing<br> because of people wanting to become Shrek. This is<br> becoming a Shrek apocalypse and people need to spread<br> the word to be safe.

This<br> brought Dreamworks attention so they gathered Eddie<br> Murphy (Donkey), Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz<br> (Fiona), and the rest of the Shrek cast to start filming<br> and animating the movie. Shrek fans do everything to<br> honor Shrek, they vary from Shrek meetups, you see<br> profile pictures of Shrek, even they came up with a<br> new phrase called Shrexy.

        Joe Rogan was driving his 2002 Honda Civic near<br> a pack of Psychopathic ducks when a duck ran<br> in front of his car. Of course Joe would not hurt a<br> fly so he quickly served to the right to avoid the<br> near helpless quaker but that is not even the worst<br> part. Since he was driving next to an ice fishing pond<br> and his car was on the ice he hit 9 of the 82 ice fishers<br> there until his car hit another duck so it stopped. Though<br> that is still not the worst part (Well I guess it is) because<br> one of the people that he hit was none other than the<br> girl from the carseat meme (She and another duck were<br> found in a frozen block of ice, and of course they were<br> dead). Joe Rogan was sued 24 Million dollars in all from<br> about 840 professional memers. Shaquille O’Neal<br> commented on this incident saying quote, “If little Joey<br> hits another person he will have to face the consequences.<br> Thank you for reading this article and I hope you never<br> end up like Joey because Shaq will come for you.
