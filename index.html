        Ronald Mcdonald, the McDonalds mascot has finally retired<br> after 42 years of dressing up like a clown. He just recently<br> announced that he joined Burger King for a salary of $20<br> a year. Many people are surprised as to why he would leave<br> such a prestigous position at one of the most popular fast<br> food chains in history. Scientists believe it was because<br> "little kids would bully him for looking like an idiot" says<br> scientist from McDonalds University. A lot of people have<br> gone into depression after their famous mascot left. Johnson<br> Pooip said "I love Ronald and wish I could marry him." After<br> some further investigation, authorites have found out that<br> Ronald Mcdonald has changed his name to Donald BurgerKing.<br> If you have any more information as to why this happened,<br> please contact <a href="mailto:220603@students.srvusd.net"><u>Arjun Mehrotra</u></a>.

        Chimpanzees have crowded small villages in North Korea<br> after man said he "hates chimpanzees." The chimpanzees<br> heard about this horrible man and quickly tracked him down.<br> They traveled across the sea from Africa to make sure that<br> man would get what he deserves. And he did. The man was<br> bombarded with chimapnzees who jumped on him and bit him<br> on his ears. A reporter who was recording this said that<br> "the man's ears were gone lol." During this attack, chimpanzees<br> came across other people who were eating bananas. Those<br> people lived to regret it. You see, the chimpanzees saw the<br> bananas and instantly went crazy. They took all the bananas<br> and chomped them all down. That day, there was so much<br> banana poop that the entire nation had to wear N95 masks<br> to not throw up every 2 seconds.

SMNews<br> has grown very popular over the last few weeks and is a<br>surprise to some people that such an honest company can<br> grow so large. Arjun Mehrotra, CEO of SMNews, is very<br> proud of the SMNews team and said that "I hope we can<br> continue doing this for the rest of the school year, maybe<br> even turn into an actual company." So many people have<br> helped SMNews grow, especially the advertising and article<br> team. "Without the advertisers we would never be here today."<br> says CEO Arjun Mehrotra. Our competitors "The New York<br> Times" and "The Wall Street Journal" stocks have crashed 180%<br> ever since February 14, 2022, the day SMNews was founded.

        Gaming mouses have been banned in the USA after kid<br> flashes the rgb light into president Doe Jiden's face. Doe<br> Jiden was so mad that he kicked the child in his face and<br> broke his "stupid gaming mouse." The parents of the kid<br> sued Doe Jiden for fraud, manslaughter, physical abuse,<br> first degree murder, and robbing a bank. The kid started<br> crying when his $5000 gaming mouse he bought off Wish.com<br> broke. He begged his parents to get him a new one but they<br> would not budge. Some reporters recorded the footage of<br> Doe Jiden being violent and sent it to everyone in the mail<br> for some reason. Doe Jiden has been replaced with Tonald<br> Drump, a former president and government worker. Scientists<br> have said that the rgb light in gaming mouses is so powerful<br> that if you compare it to the sun, it would win. This is a huge<br> problem for major companies because now they have to<br> remove the rgb factor of their mouses, which was the only<br> reason people would buy it.

        CDC Eases Covid Mask Guidelines

      <h4 class="text">
        The CDC has started to ease the covid mask guidelines after a steep drop<br> in cases and mitigation efforts nationwide. The Center for Disease Control<br> and Prevention started to assess each county by its covid severity level.<br> The three factors on assessing will be new Covid-19 cases per 100,000<br> residents in the past seven days, new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents<br> in the past seven days, and new Covid-19 related hospital admissions. There<br> were three risk categories based on Covid-19 cases: high, medium, and low.<br> The new guidelines focus on minimizing severe disease and containing any<br> new cases. The CDC now recommends school masking only in counties where<br> Covid-19 levels are high. They did this because most children are at a relatively<br> lower risk of severe disease and are mostly asymptomatic. CDC stated that<br> "We need to be able to relax our layered prevention measure when things<br> are looking up and, we need to be able to dial them again... should we have<br> a new variant or surge."

        Russian military forced their way into Kyiv, attacking by land and air.<br> Ukrainian soldiers came in to defend their capital. Volodymyr Zelenskyy<br> vowed he would not surrender until every Russian soldier was gone. <br>Vladimir Putin even called him a terrorist. On Friday, Mr. Zelenskyy<br> posted a video from Kyiv stating that "We are all here, defending our<br> independence." Ukrainian troops blew up bridges leading to Kyiv to<br> slow the progress of Russian tanks that were moving towards the city.<br>

      <h4 class="text"> Ukrainian tanks and artillery were positioned to deflect a ground assault<br> that Russia was hinting at. Ukraine was able to withstand the first Russian<br> assault but was heavily impacted by the bombings. Ukrainian officials even sought<br> help from the U.S., and other Western countries, warning them of the<br> consequences that would ensue. In the White House, Jen Psaki warned<br> "Kyiv falling is a real possibility. Even as we see resistance on the ground, Russia's<br> military continues to advance toward Kyiv." Mr. Putin's attacks raised the risk that<br> violence could spread into other surrounding countries. If Moscow wins,<br> Russia could have the potential to place forces on the border of NATO. Oleksii<br> Reznikov stated that "Ukrainians are now fighting for the future they deserve.<br> For themselves and all of Europe." The Biden administration said that they<br> were thinking of offering support to the Ukrainian military, but defense<br> officials have not yet stated when this assistance would be delivered.</h4>

        As the Russian military forces face fierce resistance from<br> the Ukrainian army and paramilitary groups, Putin decides<br> to consider deploying their new “Sukhoi SU-57” as a way<br> to demoralize the Ukranians by shooting down the “Ghost<br> of Kyiv”. “Our T-90 tanks are not effective against the<br> Ukrainian resistance”. Says Russian army general Valery<br> Vasilyevich Gerasimov. As of Monday, 15 of Russia’s new<br>T-14 armata tanks are deployed in Belarus. The Moscow<br> Kremlin argues that deploying newer vehicles will be too<br> costly and a waste of manpower. But Putin declares that<br> in order to take Kyiv, they will need vehicles that are able<br> to withstand guerilla warfare tactics.

        Apple is Closing Down After Lawsuit<br />

        Apple is closing down after a lawsuit with Microsoft.<br />
        Apple was given a copyright claim for copying one of Microsoft's<br />
        products: Microsoft Word. Apple developed Apple Word,<br />
        an almost identical replica of Microsoft Word. After a few<br />
        months, Microsoft employee Jen Stevenson found out that<br />
        Apple was copying Microsoft. She quickly filed a copyright<br />
        claim with the Washington Police and immediately caught<br />
        Apple's attention. Tim Cook tried to fight with the lawyer<br />
        but immediately realized that he wouldn't win. He was<br />
        devasted when the lawyer sent him to jail and forced Apple<br />
        to shut down on March 1, 2022. Many people try to justify<br />
        what Apple did but the lawyer did not get Tim a bail. Tim<br />
        Cook said that he would try to start a new company<br />
        called Orange, but he is in jail for the next seven years<br />
        so he can't. If you have an Apple product, the warranty<br />
        will expire, and the product will stop working in 21 days.
