      <p class="text">Image from Wikemedia Commons</p>
      <h4 class="text">
        A small conservative faction found in the suburbs of eastern
        <br />Ukraine had dubbed themselves, “Ukrussia.” Although<br />
        this newly formed faction has been disregarded by both<br />
        Nato and the USA respectively, Ukrussia has now allied with Russia,<br />
        forming a newly formed faction, dubbed, “Ukrussiarussia.”<br />
        This divergent faction has faced fire on Social Media, from<br />
        platforms like Twitter, Snapchat, and most famously, TikTok.<br />
        More trouble would come for Ukrussiarussia. Economic<br />
        downturn from both Ukraine and Russia has impacted<br />
        Ukrussiarussia more than the respective countries.<br />
        And even a more devastating loss, when Donald McDonald,<br />
        a supporting American billionaire, has gone<br />
        overweight and declined from society, thus making funds<br />
        for Ukrussiarussia, practically impossible to get. More reports<br />
        coming soon, from SMNews.

        CDC Eases Covid Mask Guidelines
      </h2>
      <img src="cdcmask.jpeg" alt="person in mask" />
      <p class="text">Image from ABC News</p>
      <h4 class="text">
        The CDC has started to ease the covid mask guidelines after a steep drop<br> in cases and mitigation efforts nationwide. The Center for Disease Control<br> and Prevention started to assess each county by its covid severity level.<br> The three factors on assessing will be new Covid-19 cases per 100,000<br> residents in the past seven days, new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents<br> in the past seven days, and new Covid-19 related hospital admissions. There<br> were three risk categories based on Covid-19 cases: high, medium, and low.<br> The new guidelines focus on minimizing severe disease and containing any<br> new cases. The CDC now recommends school masking only in counties where<br> Covid-19 levels are high. They did this because most children are at a relatively<br> lower risk of severe disease and are mostly asymptomatic. CDC stated that<br> "We need to be able to relax our layered prevention measure when things<br> are looking up and, we need to be able to dial them again... should we have<br> a new variant or surge."

        Russian military forced their way into Kyiv, attacking by land and air.<br> Ukrainian soldiers came in to defend their capital. Volodymyr Zelenskyy<br> vowed he would not surrender until every Russian soldier was gone. <br>Vladimir Putin even called him a terrorist. On Friday, Mr. Zelenskyy<br> posted a video from Kyiv stating that "We are all here, defending our<br> independence." Ukrainian troops blew up bridges leading to Kyiv to<br> slow the progress of Russian tanks that were moving towards the city.<br>

      <h4 class="text"> Ukrainian tanks and artillery were positioned to deflect a ground assault<br> that Russia was hinting at. Ukraine was able to withstand the first Russian<br> assault but was heavily impacted by the bombings. Ukrainian officials even sought<br> help from the U.S., and other Western countries, warning them of the<br> consequences that would ensue. In the White House, Jen Psaki warned<br> "Kyiv falling is a real possibility. Even as we see resistance on the ground, Russia's<br> military continues to advance toward Kyiv." Mr. Putin's attacks raised the risk that<br> violence could spread into other surrounding countries. If Moscow wins,<br> Russia could have the potential to place forces on the border of NATO. Oleksii<br> Reznikov stated that "Ukrainians are now fighting for the future they deserve.<br> For themselves and all of Europe." The Biden administration said that they<br> were thinking of offering support to the Ukrainian military, but defense<br> officials have not yet stated when this assistance would be delivered.</h4>

        As the Russian military forces face fierce resistance from<br> the Ukrainian army and paramilitary groups, Putin decides<br> to consider deploying their new “Sukhoi SU-57” as a way<br> to demoralize the Ukranians by shooting down the “Ghost<br> of Kyiv”. “Our T-90 tanks are not effective against the<br> Ukrainian resistance”. Says Russian army general Valery<br> Vasilyevich Gerasimov. As of Monday, 15 of Russia’s new<br>T-14 armata tanks are deployed in Belarus. The Moscow<br> Kremlin argues that deploying newer vehicles will be too<br> costly and a waste of manpower. But Putin declares that<br> in order to take Kyiv, they will need vehicles that are able<br> to withstand guerilla warfare tactics.

        Apple is Closing Down After Lawsuit<br />

        Apple is closing down after a lawsuit with Microsoft.<br />
        Apple was given a copyright claim for copying one of Microsoft's<br />
        products: Microsoft Word. Apple developed Apple Word,<br />
        an almost identical replica of Microsoft Word. After a few<br />
        months, Microsoft employee Jen Stevenson found out that<br />
        Apple was copying Microsoft. She quickly filed a copyright<br />
        claim with the Washington Police and immediately caught<br />
        Apple's attention. Tim Cook tried to fight with the lawyer<br />
        but immediately realized that he wouldn't win. He was<br />
        devasted when the lawyer sent him to jail and forced Apple<br />
        to shut down on March 1, 2022. Many people try to justify<br />
        what Apple did but the lawyer did not get Tim a bail. Tim<br />
        Cook said that he would try to start a new company<br />
        called Orange, but he is in jail for the next seven years<br />
        so he can't. If you have an Apple product, the warranty<br />
        will expire, and the product will stop working in 21 days.

      <h4 class="text">On the morning of Wednesday, French paratroopers<br> were seen to be deployed on the border of the Franco<br>-German border. The Bundeswehr security council<br> suspected it was an area to construct a military base,<br> but it was not what they suspected. At 9:38 AM in<br> Germany, French soldiers started unexpectedly firing<br> at their allies. German forces tried to retaliate but were<br> forced to retreat away from the border. The incident<br>  was reported by a few civilian witnesses, one of them<br> being a part of the EU council. At 11:38 French forces<br> had made their way into the German city of Stuttgart,<br> The french military also considered rapid deployment<br> of armor and aircraft in Germany. After the supposed<br> “annexing” had happened a UN peace talk was held<br> in London, which Macron attended. At the peace<br> talk many representatives have placed sanctions<br> and airspace bans for France. Macron replied with<br> “I am the new emperor, Viva l’emperur” Shortly after<br> the peace talk was done, Macron made a public announcement<br> to France and stated “Arise sons of France, Your<br> empire needs you”. The French Military had also positioned<br> 4 Navy vessels along the coast of northern Spain.</h4>
